* normal distribution
if \(X \sim N(\mu_x, \sigma_x^2)\), then \(X\) follow a random distribution with mean \(\mu\) and [[id:3a4719b3-882e-45ca-9788-24ec8d983f25][standard deviation]] \(\sigma_x\).
- The density function of \(X\) would be:
  \begin{align*}
    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}(x-\mu)^{2}}
  \end{align*}
  - \(X\) is an continuous function

In statistics, the empirical rule states that in a normal distribution, 99.7% of observed data will fall within three standard deviations of the mean. Specifically, 68% of the observed data will occur within one standard deviation, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.
