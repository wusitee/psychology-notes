a visual cliff involves an apparent. but not actual drop from one surface to another, created to test babies' depth perception.
+ newborns can perceive depth (grows with age)

Binocular cues are those that require the use of both eyes (integrated by the brain) in order for us to perceive depth or distance.
** Convergence
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ba347ad1-338e-4f73-aded-6f6ec3fb4815
:END:
Our eyes move together to focus on a close object (cross-eyed) and move farther apart for a distant object.
* retinal disparity

:END:
The difference between the visual images that each eye perceives because of the different angles in which each eye views the world
+ close -greater disparity
* monocular cue

clues that can be used for depth perception that involves using only one eye.
** linear perspective

:END:
Parallel lines appear to converge at a vanishing point on the horizon
+ the closer together the two lines are, the greater the distance will seem.
** interposition
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       15c7721a-b7a1-4797-98d5-a4c3f75cd716
:ROAM_ALIASES: overlap
:END:
When one object overlaps another, the object that is partially obscured is perceived as being farther away.
** relative size
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f4a9e29d-b48d-4257-9b52-058ad165536c
:END:
If two objects are roughly the same size, the father away object will appear smaller even though the objects are still the same size.
** relative clarity
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2658e91f-32c0-4069-9ff6-ed717213b64a
:END:
we perceive hazy objects as farther away than sharp, clear objects
+ The farther something is from us, the less detail it conveys.
** texture gradient
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b7c6b88a-478c-4331-bd9e-66274cb91728
:END:
distant objects have a smoother texture than nearby objects
+ more details for near ones.
