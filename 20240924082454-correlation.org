* correlation
the correlation \(r\) measures the *linear* direction and strength of the association.
- which means it doesn't indicate any other non-linear information (relation, etc.).

+ the value of correlation always between {{c1::-1 and 1}}
+ in the case of {{c1::\(r = 1\) or \(r = -1\)}}, there must be a perfect linear relationship.
+ the stronger the linear relationship, the closer the \({\left| r \right| }\) to {{c1::1}}.
* Correlation doesn't imply causation
This [[www.tylervigen.com/spurious/correlation][Web]] shows that it is the case.
\begin{align*}
r &= \frac{1}{n-1} \cdot \sum\left( \frac{x_{i}-\bar{x}}{S_{x}}\right) \left(\frac{y_{i}-\bar{y}}{S_{y}}\right) \\
 &= \frac{Cov[X,Y]}{\sigma_{X}\cdot \sigma_{Y}}
